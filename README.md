# VacciNation Application
Booking system command line prototype.
Command line based user interface for managing vaccination. The options allowed users to register vaccine, register hospital, register citizen. Registered hospitals are given Unique ID, which they can use to add slots for vaccination on different days. They can choose the number of slots they want to add, the quantity of vaccines they have and the type of vaccine (from the list of registered vaccines).
